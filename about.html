			After graduating from Michigan State University with a degree in Marketing, I knew I wanted to do more.
            I enjoy learning so I was excited about the idea of going to graduate school.
            I landed on UX Design after doing a small personal project and thinking about my interests.
            I love to build things, whether it is a puzzle or furniture, and UX allows me to incorporate that into a career.
            By taking individual small pieces of a site and eventually bringing them all together to create one great piece is just like putting together a puzzle or assembling furniture.
            This, along with my interest of technology, persuaded me to pursue this field at The University of Michigan.

        <p class="p2">
            During my free time, I love to hang out with my friends, my family and play with my dog. I also love to cook and bake.
            It is so fun and relaxing to cook, it's my "me time".
			Although I haven't done much traveling, I would love to be able to travel more, especially internationally. The only time I have been outside of the country is when I traveled to Israel.
			I enjoy puzzles and games. My favorite game to play with my family is Rummikub.
			I love watching reality TV. Some of my favorites are Love Island, Survivor and The Real Housewives. I am also a major fan of The Office.
