			I had the opportunity to work with The Carr Center, a Detroit-based cultural arts center showcasing African and African American arts, to improve their online platform called the Carr Virtual Center (CVC). The CVC is a site that holds the works of The Carr Center, including artworks, performances, artist collections, and more. The original iteration of the CVC was created when the pandemic hit, as a way for people to access The Carr Center's content from the comfort of their own home, no matter where they are.
            I was one of three UX research and design interns working on the CVC for two months. I conducted background research, reviewed the needs of The Carr Center staff members, and designed prototypes. The new CVC that we created consists of virtual galleries to showcase the artworks as well as a lounge to encourage conversations between users about the artworks, a theater to highlight their performances, a library archive of artists, and an events page where users can stay up to date on upcoming events.

            For my class, Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation, my group had the opportunity to partner with The University of Michigan for their historical artifact game, Collect Connect. This game encourages conversations between users to make connections between different artifacts that can be found at the libraries and museums on campus.
            Our goal throughout the semester was to conduct multiple methods of research to evaluate Collect Connect and provide recommendations for improvement. 
            Our group completed an interaction map, a competitive evaluation, a heuristic evaluation, interviews, surveys, and usability tests.
            Some of our recommendations were: create an interactive tutorial at the beginning of the game instead of the text-heavy instructions or if you continue to use text instructions, fix the scrolling issues and add more context to the instructions (such as: what is a connection, the goal of the game, images aiding the instructions, etc.)​, add an 'exit' and ‘back to homepage’ button on the summary screen once the game is finished, remove the ‘end turn’ button altogether - automatically end the person's turn when they play the card, and change the structure so that the user presses ‘final play’ first and then selects the card they want to play.

			This was an independent, semester-long project for my Introduction to Interactive Design course. Our class was given the task to create a tool to solve a common problem.
            The problem I decided to focus on was that students decrease their productivity by getting distracted by their cell phones. My goal for this tool was to allow users to improve their study habits by focusing on getting their homework done to the best of their ability. The target audience for this project were students. I created an application called TaskCheck, which is a checklist tool combined with an app blocker.
            TaskCheck is an app where the user creates tasks that they need to accomplish for their dedicated homework time. Distracting apps will then be blocked until all tasks are checked off, signifying that they are completed. Under settings, the user can select which apps on their phone they find distracting. Using Adobe XD, I created low-fidelity prototypes and finished with a mid-fidelity prototype. I conducted six interviews, created personas, and completed usability testing.

			During my time in the course Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations, we spent the semester working on a consulting project for a company called Brandmotion. Brandmotion is an automotive technology company that sells safety products for every car, regardless of how old it is.
            My team, which consisted of myself and three other classmates, were assigned the task of providing recommendations about ways to improve their current product development process.
            We started the interview process by creating an interview protocol with all of the questions we wanted to ask. The questions varied by department. We conducted out interviews via Zoom, due to the pandemic. We wanted to see how the employees truly felt about their current process, so we ensured that anything they said would be kept anonymous in our final report.
            Some of our recommendations were: create a visual aid, either physical or virtual, to better track team progress at a glance, initial meeting with all stakeholders to cover the “stage gates” necessary for each and every product and discuss what stages might be agreed as unnecessary, and create two separate processes for Class 1 and Class 2 with the appropriate stages for each.

        <h2>Dog Rescue Website</h2>

			Before graduate school, I was unsure about what career path I wanted to pursue. After talking to people in many different engineering and tech positions, I attempted to create a website with a family friend. He was a front end engineer who offered to teach me a bit of coding to create a website from scratch. I chose to create a site for a dog rescue. The website was never finished or published - it was simply a personal project just to see if I enjoyed designing and developing a site. We only spent a few days creating this, but I found myself trying to do more and more on my own time, which showed me that I really enjoyed the design aspect. This project was what convinced me that UX was the right career path for me and that is how I decided to pursue a Master's degree for UX Design.
