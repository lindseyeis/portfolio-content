		<p>
			I am pursuing my Master of Information at The University of Michigan, with a focus in User Experience Design.
            I am passionate about learning how to create usable digital products.
            I have worked on several projects throughout my time at school and internship that showcase what I have learned thus far.

            Along with my interest in UX design, I also have an interest in front-end developement. I have taken courses
            to learn Javascript, Python, HTML, and CSS.
