			Hi, I'm Lindsey! Welcome to my portfolio! I am pursuing my Master of Information at The University of Michigan, with a focus in User Experience Design.
            I am passionate about learning how to create usable digital products.
            I have worked on several projects throughout my time at school and internship that showcase what I have learned thus far.
			Along with my interest in UX design, I also have an interest in front-end developement. I have taken courses
            to learn Javascript, Python, HTML, and CSS. My most recent interest is in graphic design. I have a lot of fun playing around
			with Photoshop and Illustrator.
		</p>
        <p class="p2">
            In this portfolio, you will learn about me and my experiences. You are starting here, on the home page.
			On the 'About Me' tab, you will learn a little bit about me and my interests. 
			Next, on the 'Work' tab, you can find my final internship creation, as well as all of my course projects. There are images attached to get a sense of what the projects were all about.
			Finally, on the 'Resume' tab, you can find my work experience and education. There is a link to my LinkedIn profile if you would like to connect and there is a form if you would like to get in contact with me.
